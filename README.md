# Demo syntax

hello world:

```cat
main =>> IO =
    println "Hello, world" -- `println` is auto imported from `std.io.stdout.console.println`
```

# Why NO C?

Because C isn't clean...... its dirty and not good to dev

Yes, C is fast..., but is now way to OLD for programmers....
even nasm is better than it...

I think I'm going to write a new assembler for catlang.....because masm is way to bad..fasm and nasm is not enough, gnu asm is too much
and because I am poor....I don't have arm computer..I can only do x86 😟
